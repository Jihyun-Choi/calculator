# Gini and Entropy Calculator

This calculator was developed to quickly and simply calculate Gini and Entropy values, while studying data mining and information theory in the first semester of 2023.

Decision Tree, one of the most useful classification techniques in data mining, uses Gini and Entropy as indicators for selecting attributes. In information theory, binary entropy is used as a measure of uncertainty or amount of information.

For convenience of calculation, decision trees are assumed to be binary classification and binary class.

## Usage

To calculate Gini and Entropy values, simply enter the numerator x and the denominator n. Binary entropy does not require the value of x, and if n is an integer, it is calculated by multiplying n by 0.1 to make it a probability.

The formula is written at the top of the calculator so that you can clearly understand the calculations.
